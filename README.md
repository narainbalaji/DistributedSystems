# DistributedSystems

## Sharding

* Horizontal sharding
* Vertical sharding
* Consistent hashing
* Nomralized and denormalized data structures

## Synchronization

Co-operation between processes to come up with an ordered set of operations

* Mutual exclusion based synchronization
* Wait free synchronization
* Lock free synchronization
* Obstruction free synchronization
* Avoiding synchronization
** Append only data structures (no overwrite)
** Conflict free replicated data types

## Back pressure

* Throttling
* Exponential retries

## Traffic shaping 

* Queuing
* Leaky bucket

## Distributed decision making

* Complete information
* Random decision
* Paxos (Best of random)
